<br />

🤸‍♂️ I’m currently on a sabbatical having fun doing things that I haven't yet found an employer to pay me to do

<br />

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ☝🏻 
  * German Centre for Open Source AI:
    * Improving the architecture and interface design of Deep Learning models in [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/)
    * Migrating the backend of Deep Learning time series models in [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/) from TensorFlow to PyTorch
  * building a wooden cabin 🪵
  * BlueDot Impact's Technical AI Safety course ☢️
<!--  * building ML/DS's widely used methods from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms & tradeoffs -->
<!--  * [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) -->

<br />

### 🔭 I’ve previously worked on 🕵🏻‍♂️
* Founded a product and UX design agency specializing in AI products 📲
* Built dynamic pricing models at PriceLabs for short term rental revenue optimization 📈
* Integrated moderm ML techniques into legacy Avionics products at Honeywell Aerospace as an ML Tech Lead ✈️



<br />

### 🌱 In my free time I love ✨
  * going for long walks 🚶  
  * reading and all things literary 📚
  * looking at trees outside my window 🌲

<br />

### 🤔 I'm currently thinking about 💡
  * How come classical statistical models were ok with less data but new machine learning models based on same are not?
  * Why is Bayesian way of inferencing probabilities so unintuitive? (atleast to me)
  * Machine learning design patterns and MLOps!!
