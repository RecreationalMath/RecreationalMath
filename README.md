🤸‍♂️ I’m currently on a sabbatical having fun doing things that I haven't yet found an employer to pay me to do

<br />

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ☝🏻 
  * building a wooden cabin
  * building ML/DS's widely used methods from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms & tradeoffs
  * [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)

<br />

### 🌱 In my free time I love ✨
  * going for long walks 🚶  
  * reading and all things literary 📚
  * looking at trees outside my window 🌲
  * driving 🚘

<br />

### 🤔 I'm currently thinking about 💡
  * How come classical statistical models were ok with less data but new machine learning models based on same are not?
  * Why is Bayesian way of inferencing probabilities so unintuitive? (atleast to me)
  * Machine learning design patterns and MLOps!!
